## About

This project takes audio recordings of spoken digits (0â€“9) and uses a machine learning / signal processing model to convert them into textual representation. Itâ€™s useful for simple speech recognition tasks focused on digits (e.g. recognizing phone numbers, PINs, etc.).

## Features

- Recognizes single spoken digits (0 through 9)  
- Simple architecture, easily extensible  
- Pretrained model (if provided)  
- Ability to train on custom audio datasets  

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- Libraries
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy` or `librosa` (for audio feature extraction)
  - `skikit-learn` or other ML framework used
  - `sounfile` or `wave` (for audio loading)  
- (Optional) GPU if you expand the model
-  A trained model (provided as model.pkl)

## Instalation
